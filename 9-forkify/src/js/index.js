 * MODERN JAVASCRIPT; USING ES6, NPM, BABEL AND WEBPACK
 *
 * Modern JavaScript is not so much about the language itself, but it more about the eco system that we use to write
 * it in.
 * We still write the exact same JavaScript code, but we use it together with a set of tools that make it easier and
 * better to work with and the foundation of all these tools is the NODE.JS and NPM eco system where we can find all
 * kinds of third party open source tools, libraries and frameworks development tools need for modern web development.
 * Libraries and Frameworks we have things like React, Angular, jquery Lodash etc, we also have Developments tools like
 * for task automations, automatic browser reloading or to compare Javascript from ES6 down to ES5.
 * In order to use and share these packages we need some kind og toll to install and manage them and that's when
 * the Node Package Manager (NPM) comes it which is a simple command line tool. NPM also allows us to write scripts
 * for use with development tools. See Notes.docx in this section.
